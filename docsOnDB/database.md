To set up a MySQL database for our Neobank application, we'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install MySQL Server: Download and install MySQL Server on your local machine or use a remote MySQL server if available.

2. Create a Database: We'll create a database to store user information, such as usernames, emails, and passwords.

3. Create a User Table: Within the database, we'll create a table to store user credentials.

Here's the code to set up the MySQL database and create the necessary table:

```sql
-- Create the neobank database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS neobank;

-- Use the neobank database
USE neobank;

-- Create the users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

You can execute the above SQL commands in your MySQL client or tool of choice to create the database and table.

Once the database is set up, we can proceed with integrating it into our Java application for user registration and login functionality. Let me know if you need assistance with that part!
