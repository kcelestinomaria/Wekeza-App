Absolutely! Integrating the Safaricom M-Pesa Java SDK into your Neobank CRUD app can provide seamless payment capabilities for your users. Here's a general overview of how we can proceed:

1. **Include SDK Dependency**: First, we need to include the Safaricom M-Pesa Java SDK as a dependency in your Neobank project. We'll typically do this by adding the SDK's Maven coordinates to your `pom.xml` file.

2. **Configure SDK**: Next, we'll configure the SDK by providing necessary parameters such as the API key, public key, and environment (sandbox or production). This configuration will usually be done during SDK initialization using the `MpesaBuilder` class.

3. **Integrate SDK Methods**: We'll integrate the SDK's methods into your Neobank app where necessary. For example, when a user wants to make a payment or perform any M-Pesa transaction, we'll call the appropriate method from the SDK.

4. **Handle Callbacks and Responses**: We'll handle callbacks and responses from M-Pesa API requests appropriately within your Neobank app. This includes handling success responses, error responses, and any other relevant data returned by the M-Pesa API.

5. **Testing**: Once integration is complete, thorough testing of the M-Pesa functionality within your Neobank app is crucial to ensure everything works as expected. We'll perform unit tests and possibly integration tests to verify the behavior of the integrated SDK.

6. **Documentation and Maintenance**: Finally, we'll document the integration process and any customizations made to the SDK for your Neobank app. Regular maintenance and updates to the SDK should also be considered to ensure compatibility with future changes.

Let me know if you're ready to start, and we can proceed with the integration process! If you have any specific preferences or requirements, feel free to share them as well.
