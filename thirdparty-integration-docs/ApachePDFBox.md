If you're using Java with Ant for your project, you can still integrate Apache PDFBox to generate PDF reports. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Download PDFBox JARs**: First, download the Apache PDFBox library JAR files from the official website or any trusted source. Make sure to download the core library (`pdfbox-x.y.z.jar`) and its dependencies.

2. **Add JARs to Classpath**: Once you've downloaded the JAR files, add them to your Ant project's classpath. You can do this by placing the JAR files in a directory within your project, such as a `lib` directory, and then referencing them in your Ant build script.

3. **Configure Ant Build Script**: Modify your Ant build script (usually named `build.xml`) to include tasks for compiling your Java code and running the PDF report generation. You'll need to specify the classpath to include the PDFBox JARs, and you'll also need to define a target for generating the PDF report.

Here's an example of how you can modify your `build.xml` file:

```xml
<project name="YourProject" default="build" basedir=".">
    
    <!-- Define properties -->
    <property name="src.dir" value="src"/>
    <property name="build.dir" value="build"/>
    <property name="lib.dir" value="lib"/>
    <property name="report.dir" value="reports"/>

    <!-- Define classpath -->
    <path id="classpath">
        <fileset dir="${lib.dir}">
            <include name="*.jar"/>
        </fileset>
        <pathelement location="${build.dir}"/>
    </path>

    <!-- Compile Java source files -->
    <target name="compile">
        <mkdir dir="${build.dir}"/>
        <javac srcdir="${src.dir}" destdir="${build.dir}" classpathref="classpath"/>
    </target>

    <!-- Generate PDF report -->
    <target name="generate-report" depends="compile">
        <java classname="PDFReportGenerator" classpathref="classpath">
            <arg value="${report.dir}/report.pdf"/>
        </java>
    </target>

    <!-- Default target -->
    <target name="build" depends="generate-report"/>

</project>
```

4. **Implement PDF Report Generation**: Implement the PDF report generation logic in a Java class, similar to the example I provided earlier. Make sure to name the class `PDFReportGenerator` and include a `main` method that accepts an output file path as an argument.

5. **Run Ant Build Script**: Run your Ant build script to compile your Java code and generate the PDF report. You can do this by executing the `ant` command in your project directory.

This setup should allow you to integrate Apache PDFBox into your Java project using Ant for PDF report generation. Make sure to replace `"PDFReportGenerator"` with the actual name of your PDF report generation class, and customize the build script as needed for your project structure and requirements.
